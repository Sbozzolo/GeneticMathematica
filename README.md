# MagicMathematicaSquare
Magic.m is a collection of tools to solve an NxN normal magic square using different stochastic tecniques: genetic algorithm and evolutionary algorithm.

The genetic approach contains:
- differents fitness functions
- a notion of distance between squares
- differents selection functions (fitness proportionate, elitism, fittest)

There is a semideterministic algorithm for small N, which doesn't converges.

The genetic approach does not converges.

Now it's in development an evolutionary approach.
